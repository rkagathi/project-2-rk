Visualizing traffic and air quality of Chicago
Kanika, Rajesh, Tom, and Angang

How does Chicago traffic change over time? Is there a relationship between traffic patterns and air quality? How about the relationship between traffic and business locations?

1. General ideas

Interactively display hourly traffic and hourly air quality of Chicago on a map
    - Plot a map layer of traffic (e.g. in a way similar to Google map traffic)
    - Plot a map layer of the location(s) of meteorological station
    - Create a side panel of air quality metrics, such as Particulate Matters (PM) and ozone (PM and street-level ozone are very bad for human health)
    - Make the contents interactive, such that user can specify (e.g. sliding bar) the date and hour to display
    - As default, display concurrent traffic and air quality data

Extending this idea:
    - Summarize how air quality correlates with overall traffic
    - Summarize how air quality varies under different weather conditions

Extending even more:
    - Explore divvy bike, taxi, and CTA utilities during rush hours
